# PythonBasis
A small repository to contain my code on making a representation of flavour vs mass basis for neutrinos

Packages needed:
matplotlib
matplotlib.cm
numpy

Some global TODOS: Move constant definitions to constants.py and access from there; Fix iteration colours issue and move elsewhere in case more vectors need to be plotted.

What I need to fix: For some reason using the hermitian conjugate of the mixing matrix is looking better than just using PMNS. Check that I'm not doing matrix multiplication wrong. Value printouts for PMNS seem sensible compared to wiki.
