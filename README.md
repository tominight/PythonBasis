# PythonBasis
A small repository to contain my code on making a representation of flavour vs mass basis for neutrinos

Packages needed:
matplotlib
matplotlib.cm
numpy

Some global TODOS: Move constant definitions to constants.py and access from there; Fix iteration colours issue and move elsewhere in case more vectors need to be plotted.
